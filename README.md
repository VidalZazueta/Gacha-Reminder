# Gacha-Reminder
## Description
A discord bot to remind users about the current events in their favorite gacha game. As more gacha games continue to release very year, it becomes increasingly harder manage several different gacha games. Many of these gacha games have to be launched through their own service, so logging in to see what events are available will take a couple of minutes. Adding multiple games on top of this and it becomes harder to manage what game you want to play so you don't miss out on any events.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a discord bot to give users consistent reminders about the current events in their favorite gacha games. Showing users what events are available and what events will end soon will help them manage their time and prioritize the right game.

## Progress
Currently the game only handles event requests for the game Wuthering Waves. I plan to add a way to get events from other gacha games as well, such as Zenless Zone Zero, Genshin Impact, and more.

## Technologies Used
Python  
Visual Studio Code or any text editor  
Postgresql (planned)

## Packages
discord.py  
python-dotenv  
psycog2-binary  
requests  
supabase  
aiohttp 

## Planned Features
Filtering by event type (In-Game vs Web events)  
Showing upcoming events (starting soon)  
Adding timezone handling for the UTC+8 offsets  
Sorting events by end date to show which ones are ending soonest
