# Gacha-Reminder
## Description
A discord bot to remind users about the current events in their favorite gacha game. As more gacha games continue to release very year, it becomes increasingly harder manage several different gacha games. Many of these gacha games have to be launched through their own service, so logging in to see what events are available will take a couple of minutes. Adding multiple games on top of this and it becomes harder to manage what game you want to play so you don't miss out on any events.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a discord bot to give users consistent reminders about the current events in their favorite gacha games. Showing users what events are available and what events will end soon will help them manage their time and prioritize the right game.

## Current Progress
Currently the game only handles event requests for the game Wuthering Waves. I plan to add a way to get events from other gacha games as well.  

Currently the game supports getting the ingame events for the game Wuthering Waves and Zenless Zone Zero, which are the games I primarily play.
