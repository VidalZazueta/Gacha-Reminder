# Gacha-Reminder
## Description

As more gacha games continue to release very year, it becomes increasingly harder manage several different gacha games. Many of these gacha games have to be launched through their own service, so logging in to see what events are available will take a couple of minutes. Adding multiple games on top of this and it becomes harder to manage what game you want to play so you don't miss out on any events.

Python  
Visual Studio Code or any text editor
